          <p class="lead">
            CarPolly is a fun and easy way to organize carpools for events. Whether you're planning a trip to the ice rink,
            a concert, or any group outing, Carpollies helps you coordinate rides with your friends and fellow "parrots".
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the social nature of parrots, CarPolly makes sharing rides as natural as a flock taking flight together.
            Create your event, share the link, and let everyone join as drivers or passengers. It's that simple!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to make group transportation hassle-free, so you can focus on enjoying the event rather than
            worrying about logistics.
          </p>
